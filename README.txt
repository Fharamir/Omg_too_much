Hi guys, I'm Federico and this is "Omg_too_much" a very small tool
to check the RAM usage on the PC.

I think the simpliest way to show an information is the graphical way.
The tool will show a green, orange or red bar showing how much RAM the computer is using related to how much it has.

There is no more to say, this is just my first test uploading something on GitHub.

Have a nice day :)
